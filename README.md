# My Heart Counts

This repository contains the My Heart Counts iOS application, which is implemented using the [Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/Spezi) ecosystem and builds on top of the [Stanford Spezi Template Application](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziTemplateApplication).

> [!NOTE]  
> Do you want to learn more about the Stanford Spezi Template Application and how to use, extend, and modify this application? Check out the [Stanford Spezi Template Application documentation](https://stanfordspezi.github.io/SpeziTemplateApplication).


## My Heart Counts Features

*coming soon*


## Setting Up a Local Development Environment
In order to run and develop the My Heart Counts app locally, you'll need the following:
1. A firebase environment
2. A study bundle
3. The app itself (either in the simulator or on a real device)

### The Study Definition
1. Go to the definitions submodule: `cd MyHeartCounts-StudyDefinitions`
2. Run `swift run MHCStudyDefinitionExporterCLI export ..` to generate a study bundle
    - This will place a `mhcStudyDefinition.spezistudybundle.aar` file in the root of the MyHeartCounts-iOS repo
    - you can have it saved elsewhere by replacing the `..` with the path of the folder where you want the study definition to be placed

### The Firebase Environment
1. Go to the firebase submodule: `cd MyHeartCounts-Firebase`
2. Run `npm run prepare`
3. Run `npm run serve:seeded`

### The App Itself
1. Clone this repo (https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/MyHeartCounts-iOS)
2. Disable SensorKit and adjust the Codesign options
    - (You can skip this step if you have access to a Stanford-generated provisioning profile and have Stanford's codesign certificate installed locally.)
    - Open `MyHeartCounts.entitlements` and remove the `com.apple.developer.sensorkit.reader.allow` entry
    - Change the bundle identifiers in all targets (e.g., by adding a custom prefix)
        - Note: you'll also need to edit the watch app's Info.plist and adjust the `WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier` entry
    - Select your own development team in the MyHeartCounts and MyHeartCountsWatchApp targets, and enable the automatic code signing option
3. Adjust the app's run configuration (open via `cmd+shift+,`) and enable the following options:
    - `--useFirebaseEmulator`
        - If you wish to use a custom firebase deployment instead of a local emulator, you'll need to use the `--overrideFirebaseConfig plist=name` flag instead, where `name` is either an absolute path of a GoogleService-Info.plist file (this will only work in the simulator), or the filename (without extension) of a GoogleService-Info.plist file bundled with the app.
    - `--overrideStudyBundleLocation`
        - Specify the absolute path of the `.aar` file generated above
        - Note: if you're running the app on a physical device, specifying the file location on the Mac won't work, since the iPhone can't access that. Instead, you can do one of the following:
            - Bundle the study definition into the app:
                - Drag the `.aar` file into the app's Resources folder in Xcode
                - Adjust the code in the `StudyBundleLoader` type to simply always load from that in-bundle URL
            - Host the study definition using the Firebase storage emulator:
                - Open the Storage emulator (likely at http://localhost:4000/storage)
                - Upload the `mhcStudyBundle.spezistudybundle.aar` file to the `/public` folder
                - Configure the `--overrideStudyBundleLocation` argument to point to `http://HOSTNAME.local:9199/v0/b/myheart-counts-development.appspot.com/o/public%2FmhcStudyBundle.spezistudybundle.aar?alt=media`
                    - Note that you'll need to replace `HOSTNAME` with your Mac's local-network name (you can find this in Settings.app → General → Sharing → Local hostname)
    - `--disableAutomaticBulkHealthExport`
        - (this option will disable the historical health data collection, improving performance when running the app on a real device)

> [!NOTE]  
> Please make sure not to commit and push any of the SensorKit, Code Signing, and run argument changes listed above; these changes are only required for local development.
