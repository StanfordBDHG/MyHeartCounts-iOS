## CONSENT TO BE PART OF A RESEARCH STUDY


You are invited to participate in a research study, "My Heart Counts," which aims to understand and promote heart health. Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time. The study involves completing surveys and tracking your physical activity to gather data on your cardiovascular health. Participation may include minimal risks related to data confidentiality. While you may not receive any direct benefits, your involvement will contribute to valuable research that could benefit many others by advancing our understanding of heart health. Please note that participation in this study is not a substitute for medical treatment, and no financial compensation will be provided.


### PURPOSE OF RESEARCH

You are invited to participate in a research study on the use of a mobile phone application (“My Heart Counts app”) to collect research data on your daily activity, fitness, and cardiovascular health status. Prior research using surveys on physical activity and fitness have shown that these can reduce the risk of developing heart and blood vessel disease, such as heart attack and stroke (also called cardiovascular disease). Mobile phones and wearable devices can now measure physical activity and fitness, offering improved methods to research the impact of activity and fitness on cardiovascular health. The goal of this study is to use the quantitative capabilities and wide availability of mobile devices to enhance our knowledge of the relationships among activity, fitness, and heart health.

Additionally, you are invited to participate in a randomized crossover trial within the My Heart Counts application that will last 2 weeks. The purpose of this research is to evaluate whether personalized exercise coaching prompts generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) can effectively increase physical activity and improve cardiovascular health compared to generic coaching prompts. By comparing physical activity levels, engagement, and cardiovascular health metrics between these two conditions, the study aims to determine if personalized, AI-generated coaching can better motivate individuals to adopt healthier behaviors and ultimately enhance heart health.

This research study is looking for 15,000 adult smartphone users as all adults are at risk of for cardiovascular disease. Enrollment will occur throughout the United States.  Stanford University expects to enroll 15,000 research study participants.


### VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION

Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary.  Your decision not to participate will not have any negative effect on you or your medical care.  You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study or trial without any loss of benefits or medical care to which you are entitled.


### DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT

This research study is expected to take approximately a year. During this study and every 3 months, the My Heart Counts app will ask you actively participate by using your phone or wearable to collect activity data for 7 days, performing exercise tests, and answering surveys. These surveys should take you less than 5 minutes each, so active participation should be less than 10-15 minutes per day.

Your participation in the randomized crossover trial will last approximately three weeks. During this period, you will have a one week baseline period. Then, you will receive personalized exercise coaching prompts for one week and generic prompts for another week, in randomized order. Active participation will require a couple of minutes per day, including completing brief surveys on some days (about 5 minutes each). You may choose to participate actively on some days and not others, but we encourage consistent participation throughout the three-week trial period.


### PROCEDURES

You will be asked to download the My Heart Counts app on your smartphone and go through screens that will determine eligibility, describe the study to you, and ask you to provide informed consent and ask if you would like to enroll in the randomized controlled trial or not. If you provide consent, a copy of this consent form will be emailed to you. You will then be asked to allow the My Heart Counts app to collect health and activity data from your phone, followed by questions about your physical activity readiness and any history of cardiovascular disease and risk factors.

During this study and every 3 months, the My Heart Counts app will ask you to do three things:
1. use your phone, or any wearable activity device you have, to collect activity data for 7 days.
2. if able, perform exercise tests, including a six-minute walk evaluation, and a 12-minute walk or run test, using the phone or a wearable device to measure distance and record heart rate. Prior to beginning any exercise test, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire on physical fitness to determine the appropriateness of exercise testing. Depending on your response, you may be asked to speak with your doctor before completing any exercise tests. You will be asked to only do exercise evaluations that you feel comfortable doing. You are not required to do any or all of the exercise evaluations to continue using the app.
3. you will be asked to input information about risk factors (e.g. chronic health conditions, mindset regarding health and exercise, diet, and smoking) and any change in heart disease status. There will also be surveys to inform My Heart Count's physical activity coaching.  These surveys should take you less than 5 minutes each, so active participation should be less than 10-15 minutes per day.

The My Heart Counts app will provide feedback on several items including your six-minute walk distance and your cardiovascular risk evaluation. The My Heart Counts app will also provide educational links to learn more about any of your data. The My Heart Counts app will continue to collect activity data in between the 3-month timepoints and you can continue to use the app to view your data. 

Participants in this randomized crossover trial will be asked to use the My Heart Counts mobile application over a three-week period. After enrollment, participants will go through the baseline week which will consist of daily surveys and general data collection. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either personalized exercise coaching prompts generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) or generic coaching prompts for the first week and then crossover to the other type of prompts for the final week. Throughout the study, participants will receive daily coaching messages and will be asked to complete brief surveys to assess their physical activity, engagement, and overall experience. Physical activity data will be passively collected via HealthKit integration within the app.

We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, personal photos, texts, or email messages. At times during the study, the app may provide additional information about your heart risk, additional methods to encourage you to increase your activity level. You may also be re-contacted in the future about additional research opportunities, including adding other health data to your My Heart Counts data. 

This application is not a replacement for a healthcare provider. You should continue to contact your healthcare provider regarding your health and clinical care. 

Future Use of Private Information
Research using private information is an important way to try to understand human disease.  You are being given this information because the investigators want to save private information for future research.  

Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and, after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from you. 


### PARTICIPANT RESPONSIBILITIES          

As a participant, your responsibilities include:
- Follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff.
- Complete your questionnaires and active tasks as instructed.
- Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you change your mind about staying in the study or simply withdraw from the study.


### WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY

If you first agree to participate and then you change your mind, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue your participation at any time.  Your decision will not affect your ability to receive medical care for your disease and you will not lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled. 

If you decide to withdraw your consent to participate in this study, you should notify Dr. Daniel Seung Kim at myheartcounts@stanford.edu, (650) 721-3944. After reaching out, you will be withdrawn from the study. After withdrawing, you can delete the mobile application from your device. Data collected on you to the point of withdrawal remains part of the study database and may not be removed per the Food and Drug Administration.

The Protocol Director may also withdraw you from the study without your consent for one or more of the following reasons:  
- Failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff.
- The Protocol Director decides that continuing your participation could be harmful to you.
- The study is cancelled. 
- Other administrative reasons.
- Unanticipated circumstances.     


### POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES 

There are no significant risks associated with this study.  You will be asked to complete a survey on your readiness to increase physical activity and test fitness. Despite screening and recommendations to consult a physician prior to participation, this study will include physical activity tests such as the Six-Minute Walk Test and the 12-Minute Walk/Run Test, which may pose several risks. These include cardiovascular events (e.g., increased heart rate and potential chest pain), musculoskeletal injuries (e.g., strains or sprains), dehydration, fatigue, and unanticipated medical events.


To prevent improper data access, we will use a random code instead of your name for the main study data and this coded study data will be encrypted and stored on a secure cloud server administered by Stanford Technology & Digital Solutions. While your coded data in this database will not contain information that is traditionally used to identify you, people may develop ways in the future that could allow someone to link your health information in this database back to you. For example, someone could compare information in this database with information from you in another database and be able to identify you. It also is possible that there could be violations to the security of the computer systems used to store the codes linking your health information to you. Additionally, participation in this study involves the collection of location data to measure distance traveled, which may pose a risk to your privacy as it qualifies as a personal identifier. Sharing location data is optional and your sharing status can be changed at any time. However, your privacy is very important to us and the study will make every effort to protect your privacy and the privacy of your data, but that cannot be completely guaranteed. Your coded data (without your name or email) will be combined with data from other participants for analysis by Stanford researchers and its research partners.


### POTENTIAL BENEFITS                             

We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.  Participation in this study may help you become more informed about your fitness. Participation in the trial may help you increase your physical health.
